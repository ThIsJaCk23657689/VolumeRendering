# Scientific Visualization

## Bug
* The gradient heatmap labels 
* Transfer function (UI NeedImprove) => RGB (the knots)
* Square => high frequencies with high opacities; low opacities for other table entries.
* Output the transfer function to a disk file (Cloud be more information)

## Future Work
* loading inf file
* show the information of the volume data
* the culling plane (one normal vector and a position)
* multi-part
